It is time to get back into writing. I have written a book and am working on another, but there is something liberating about writing what is top of mind.

### What you can expect

I intend to write about anything that I am passionate about. You can expect to see content about brewing beer, writing web applications, and life.

The hardest part of a blog is always getting started, so I'm going to keep it simple and to the point.
