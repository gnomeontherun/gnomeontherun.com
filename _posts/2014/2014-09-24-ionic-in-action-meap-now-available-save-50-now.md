 The MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) version of **[Ionic In Action](http://www.manning.com/books/ionic-in-action?a_aid=gnomeontherun) is now available**! This means you can buy the book today and get an updated as each chapter is released. The biggest benefit is being able to join the author forum and provide feedback, ask questions, and interact directly with me. I'll be active regularly to make sure you get the answers you need. I'm particularly interested in hearing feedback about how to make the book better.

You know what the best part is? If you **[buy the book today](http://www.manning.com/books/ionic-in-action?a_aid=gnomeontherun) you can save 50%** by using the code **mlwilken**.

I hope to see  you on the author forum!
