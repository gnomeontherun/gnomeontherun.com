I wrote an article for SitePoint about Angular 1.x Components and the type of best practices that should be considered when leveraging them. Here is the introduction, and you can read the rest on the site.

In this article, we’re going to dig into the design of components and how to put them to use inside of your applications. If you haven’t already started to use components in Angular 1, you can read about their syntax and design in one of our recent tutorials. My goal is to outline some best practices that will improve the quality of your application.

It should also be noted that many of the best practices of Angular 2 are brought into Angular 1 through the new components API, allowing you to build applications that are more easily refactored later. Angular 2 has influenced the way that we think about and design Angular 1 components, but there are still a number of distinct differences. Angular 1 is still a very powerful tool for building applications, so I believe it is worthwhile to invest in improving your applications with components even if you aren’t planning or ready to migrate to Angular 2.
