This year I'll be writing several articles for envato's Tuts+ mobile section on Ionic. 

In this tutorial, we cover:

* what Ionic is and its various components
* why you would choose to use Ionic
* how to set up your machine for building Ionic hybrid apps
* the development workflow, from starting to deploying apps

You can see the whole post at Tuts+.
