It is time for [ng-conf](http://ng-conf.org) 2016 and I'm privilidged to attend yet again. I'm going to share the state of Angular from my perspective over the next few days. 

I plan to attend pretty much all of the sessions, but I want to highlight a few things that I think will be very impactful for Angular developers. I expect most of the main sessions will be live streamed, so I highly suggest spending some time watching live (or reviewing later).

## Day 1 - All about Angular 2

If you look at the schedule, it is very clearly laid out as a learning path to the primary approaches and concepts for building Angular 2 applications. Starting with John Papa, we'll start on the ground floor with Angular 2, spend time with components, look at TypeScript's role, understand rendering on the server, handle routing, debug apps, implement testing, style apps with Angular Material, and still learn more optimization or programming appraoches. However, the highlight may be the comedic ng-show.

## Day 2 - Dig deeper into topics

Thursday is primarily about longer topical sessions that range from learning about how to contribute, to building desktop apps with Angular, to mobile apps, to all kinds of topics.

I'm particularly interested in server side rendering, as I think understanding how this all works and how to implement custom rendering will be a huge part of building scaled production applications.

## Day 3 - Techniques and concepts

The final day sessions appear to be more topical. They dig into topics like animations and promises, decorators, reactive (observables), backend data patterns, and more. These are things that will take your learnings from day 1 and enable you to build the robust applications you dream about.

In short, ng-conf appears as strong as ever. I'm excited to spend some time with the Angular community and learn some more myself. The result of my [Angular 2 in Action](https://manning.com/books/angular-2-in-action?a_aid=ionicinaction) book depends greatly on the efforts of the community to build up knowledge about Angular 2 in the real world, and I thank all of those who are speaking for their time and efforts!
