After giving a [talk on Angular 2](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS/events/224748092/) recently, one big question I felt came up in different ways was: why TypeScript? I'd like to share some insights I have into why or why not [TypeScript](typescriptlang.org) is useful to Angular developers, regardless if you are using v1 or v2. This is Part 2 of a series covering TypeScript and Angular 1 & 2.

## TypeScript as an ES6 (ESNext) transpiler



## Coming up in future posts

There are many other features and ways to look at types. I'll go into more detail about several other features and use cases for TypeScript.

* TypeScript is an ES6 transpiler as well, allowing you to leverage ES6 features today. You might use it just for ES6 support.
* Angular 2 is also written in TypeScript, which means anytime you use an Angular 2 feature TypeScript will know if you are passing the correct types of values.
* TypeScript enhances IDEs since they can inspect the source and understand more about the expectations of code, and suggest to you what values are acceptable.
